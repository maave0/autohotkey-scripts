Makes the Capslock button act as a one-shot Shift key. Press Capslock once - the next key pressed will be shifted (include numbers and other character keys). Press Ctrl+Capslock - all keys will be shifted - press Capslock to turn off.

# run on startup

To run these on startup, create a shortcut and copy it to your startup folder:

`C:\Users\YourNameHere\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

or Run (Win+R) shell:startup

# run as administrator

Sometimes the shifter doesn't work in the start menu. Right click on the shortcut > Properties > Shortcut > Advanced > Run as Administrator
